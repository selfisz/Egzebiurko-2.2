// Import needed functions from modules if they are not exposed,
// BUT since user wants "src only", we should implement these in src/main.js or src/modules/UI/index.js.
// Since we are editing src/main.js to include everything, we can put these there.
// However, I will define them here for reference to be ported to src/main.js.

// We will port these functions to src/main.js now.
